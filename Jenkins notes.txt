### Jenkin Notes

Q. What is Jenkins?
--> Jenkins is basically an build and release orchestration tool

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Jenkins in short 
--> 
	Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous 
	Delivery (CD) in DevOps pipelines. It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code 
	changes in a software project, making the development cycle faster and more efficient.

Q. Why is Jenkins Required?
--> 
	1) Automation of Repetitive Tasks: Jenkins automates tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment, 
									reducing manual efforts and human error.

	2) Continuous Integration: Jenkins continuously merges developers' code into a shared repository, allowing 
								for early detection of issues and easier collaboration.
								
								Build -> Test -> Merge

	3) Continuous Delivery/Deployment: Jenkins automates the delivery of code changes to production environments, 
										ensuring faster and safer releases.
								
								Continuous Delivery: Ready for production
								
								Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy to production 
	
	4) Extensibility: Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins, allowing customization for different tools and 
						technologies.

	5) Easy Integration: Jenkins integrates with many version control systems (like Git), build tools, and cloud
							providers, making it highly flexible.


Q. Why Jenkins is Needed:
-->
	1) Automates repetitive tasks in software development.
	2) Enables fast and frequent delivery of software updates.
	3) Helps in detecting and fixing issues early in the development process.
	4) Supports a continuous feedback loop for developers and teams.
