### How to setup GitHub Weebhook and Poll SCM in Jenkins ###

Setting up GitHub Webhook and Poll SCM in Jenkins
GitHub Webhook

In Jenkins:

Go to job configuration
Check "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" under Build Triggers


In GitHub:

Go to repository settings
Click on Webhooks > Add webhook
Payload URL: http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/
Content type: application/json
Select events to trigger webhook (usually just push events)


Test:

Make a commit and push to GitHub
Jenkins should automatically trigger a build



Poll SCM

In Jenkins job configuration:

Check "Poll SCM" under Build Triggers
Set schedule using cron syntax, e.g., H/5 * * * * for every 5 minutes


How it works:

Jenkins periodically checks the repository for changes
If changes detected, it triggers a build



Comparison

Webhook:

Faster, immediate triggers
Requires Jenkins to be accessible from GitHub
More efficient, only triggers when needed


Poll SCM:

Works behind firewalls
Can cause unnecessary load on Jenkins and GitHub
Delay between commit and build start



Choose based on your infrastructure and requirements.
